# Instruction

Step 1: Install the requirements packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step 2: Simply follow the following line to get image converted

```
python main.py -f <directory to input file> -o <folder of output image(s)>
```

For example, if you want to use the .tiff file in our 'test' folder and export it into 'outputFiles' folder inside 'test', you can copy the following command

```
python main.py -f test/inputFiles/untitled-1.pdf -o test/outputFiles
```
